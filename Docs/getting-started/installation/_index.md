# **Evaluate Aspose.OMR for .NET**
You can easily download Aspose.OMR for .NET for evaluation purposes. Please note, the evaluation version is the same as the purchased version. An evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you add a few lines of code to apply the license.

The evaluation version (without a license initialization) provides full product functionality, but it has the following limitation: it processes only 5 questions on a page.

If you want to test Aspose.OMR for .NET without the evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30-day Temporary License. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license)
